        "\n",
        "  - NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It makes mathematical and scientific calculations easy and fast. It’s widely used because it handles large data efficiently and supports many functions for data analysis, like adding, multiplying, and reshaping arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Broadcasting in NumPy lets arrays of different shapes work together in math operations. It automatically stretches the smaller array to match the shape of the larger one without copying data. This makes calculations faster and easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. A What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "\n",

        "12. What is the purpose of the describe() function in Pandas?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - The describe() function in Pandas gives a quick summary of your data.\n",
        "  - It shows important stats like count, mean, min, max, and standard deviation to help understand the data better.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Handling missing data in Pandas is important because missing values can give wrong results, cause errors, or affect data analysis.\n",
        "  - Cleaning or filling missing data helps make the analysis accurate and reliable.\n",
